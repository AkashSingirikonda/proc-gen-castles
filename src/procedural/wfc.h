    // Rotating shapes to see if they can be placed. Storing the remaining shapes in some sort of hashmap, caching stuff.
    // Defining rotations in graph space, how to represent things spacially. It's a good idea to write a type on each edge.
    // So go through and map a type to each edge? This could also be a weight, then the graph class becomes undirected weighted.
    // Once we have types of edges, you can filter that to type of connections.
    // Each tile has connections.
    // After this, run the collapse
    // Actually running the collapse.
